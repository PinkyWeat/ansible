Everything here will be ansible related. More complex and fun stuff as I go, and as I have more money lol.

#### Parts of docs
as I burnt one, these seemed relevant.

#### Inventory

Inventories organize managed nodes in centralized files that provide Ansible with system information and network locations.

Using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command.
